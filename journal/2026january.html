    <p><i>“New year, new me”, is what I would like to say…</i></p>
    <hr />

      This was a very bad way to start a year. No motivation to work for
      school, so having to force myself to focus for such long sessions isn’t
      making a lot of progress. Studying at school helps a ton. But I feel
      that there is a general mental absence. I feel like I have fucked up
      this time. Last year, I managed well. But I saw this as a sign that I
      could do the same amount of work and expect the same result. But this
      comfort lead to even less commitment and feelings of “needing to
      perform”. I have been kind of out of it for the whole semester now that
      I think about it. Spending too many lessons in the coffee shop at
      school. Whilst still working for school, I almost only did the things I
      wanted, and the things I HAD to do. Saying to myself that I think this
      lesson is boring or that I can do this better on my own. But I now
      recognized this was just another form of escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am sure that this is my passion. I love doing and learning about this.
      Even when I say about certain topics that I dislike them, I still find
      it interesting. Take for example _Windows Server_. Whilst I identify as
      a cerified 'Windows hater', I still find it interesting how it
      internally works and how to is built to work as a huge centralized
      system. Or if you look at _CCSA (Classic Computer Sorting Algorithms)_,
      I tell myself that I am not good at math, leading to not having any
      motivation before I even started. But when I am finally able to start,
      it goes okay. Not fast or anything, but certainly okay! Not that I could
      still finish these now. You cannot really recover from starting as late
      as I did. I will just have to take it and do it in the summer.
      <br />
      The 'fun' and 'peace of mind' I gave myself this semester were borrowed
      from this summer. The dream of having no redo-exams so I can study
      abroad in scandinavia has died a while ago... Together with some of my
      motivation... But all is not lost. There are still other options that
      start at the same time as our semester. This should not be something to
      lose all my motivation over.
      <br />
      I still believe I can fix nex semester, and the redo-exams afterwards. I
      still believe that I can drill everything I have learned and will learn
      into my head. Even the bussiness-related subjects, that I really do not
      find interesting at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this felt like a month of going back to the basics. I have left home
      again and moved to a student place again, or ‘kot’ as we say in Dutch.
      With it also the stress about money. As well as the motivation to earn
      some more money. I again seem to have found a studentjob where they have
      hired too many students, so there will not be enough shift for everyone
      when we are not in tourist season or exam period. So, next time they ask
      for the availabilities, I will send them immediately. But I will still
      have to work some odd jobs this intersemesterial recess.

      <br />
      This made certain thoughts resurface; The ones about the importance of
      money, and how it just feels like a constant stress and lifelong battle
      of 'having enough'. Leading to my Nihilistic thought patterns of hate
      and dispair whilst thinking about every other possible way how this
      could be better, but knowing that those ways are just an idealistic way
      of viewing a society.
      <br />
      But moving out again doesn't only come with downsides ofcourse. This
      gave same space between me and my somewhat of a hoarding personality.
      Creating some space te reevaluate what crap I really need, and what I
      should let go of. At home is my collection of shit, most of it not
      having been touched in years. But "this couldcome in handy someday" I
      guess...
      <br />
      I have finally started to pick up some hobbies I was letting to rot away
      in the past. Narrowing down on some hobbies so I actually do them.
      Instead of wanting to do everything, therefore doing nothing. I have
      only gone back climbing ones but already I feel better about myself, and
      want to take better care and give more attention to my body. This is the
      one big this I hope that having my own place will do; not locking myself
      in so much. At home with my parents, going out with some friends
      requires more planning. Looking when the bus will be there, taking the
      bus,... Now, I could just walk outside whenever. This doesn't mean that
      it will automatically happen more or anything. I still have to make it
      happen myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cooking also became a necessity again. At home it is optional. I do it
      when I want to. My parents would cook if I hadn’t. But if I don’t do it
      now, there is none. This being the first time I could truly say that I
      live alone. Living alone is different. Before, I co-housed. Living with
      2 other people, and very functioning, responsible adults. Very different
      from the man-child I can be. Now that they are not here anymore, and I
      must do all of it alone, it became clear very quickly how much you need
      to think about. But I am sure I will be able to learn this all given
      enough failures and retries. That is how I have been living my entier
      life.

      This new years has been the first time I have written (am still writing)
      my _newyears resolutions_. Having always found it some sort of cringe,
      I've never done it. But feeling like I constantly go through the same
      loop, and wanting to do something different, I just tried it. I didn't
      want it to be a generic text with things like 'excersize more' or 'study
      smarter', because I have been doing this for a long time without
      success. So I tried a deeper approache, instpired (more like copied) by
      <a href="https://youtu.be/c5tfw6_SJnc">this video by <i>Bread on Penguins</i></a>. Instead of putting the focus on
      what I want to do, putting it more on
      how and thinking preventively about how I would most likely fail. So I
      hope that this will make some sort of a difference. It hasn't been
      finished yet, because I want to think deeply about it. We'll see in
      January 2027, I geuss.

      This is a but how my month has gone. I'll try to give some monthly
      updates, unless it was a boring month with nothing worth thinking and
      writing about. This was hosted on a wordpress blog before. Even though I
      liked it, to stay in theme with the _going back to the basics_, I wanted
      something simpler. Something that showed more resemblance to older
      indexing sites, than a modern database-driven website. So it doesn't
      resemble a whole lot at the time of writing. But the goal is a bit not
      never really resamble anything. Just a way for me to transfer some
      thoughts, interests, or whatever to you, the reader. If there even are
      any.
