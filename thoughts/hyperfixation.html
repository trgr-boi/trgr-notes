      I can never be "just" interested in something. I always go overboard
      with interest until I burn out. I make it my personality almost.
      <br />
      I've stopped being super open about my fixations. Only with the people
      close to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a year now, I have built my own digital world. Most of what I use, I
      host myself. This journey started to escape from the grasp of big
      corporations and a genuine interest in privacy, but quickly became a
      hyper fixation.
      <br />
      I still genuinely like the process of doing this, and by doing this, I
      am progressing a skill that I need for both school and future work.
    </p>

    <p>But when is too much?</p>

    <p>
      Is it wrong to change old habits so they follow my new belief system?
      Why is privacy and not wanting to go along with a system, that I morally
      don't agree with, even important?

      <br />
      Idk...
      <br />
      It is just a battle i have chosen in a way. i feel like i always have to
      pick a battle, but i think everyone does. at least most of the people
      around me.
      <br />
      Will it by the next "upgrade" — or downgrade, depending how you look at
      it — be enough? Or will there be a new thing to want to change, or to
      buy?
    </p>

      So maybe is every hyper fixations just another battle. A battle that
      takes a lot of time and energy, only to be dropped when the fixation
      burns out. A battle that actually leans closer an ever-evolving form of
      mindlessly-mindful consumption. Just to in some form of another feel
      like I have a better opinion or more knowledge. To feel better than
      someone.
      <br />
      Even though I am just a no-life in a lot of ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      Does it become too much when it starts taking away from the part of life
      that truly matters?
      <br />
      Wanting to be less dependant on attention sucking companies — out of an
      annoyance of everybody getting more and more sucked in. Only to spend
      hours and hours behind a screen at home so I can be more "present" than
      the person on the bus who doesn't look away even ones when watching
      reels.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t really know where I want to go with this. These are just some
      questions that I regularly ask myself.
