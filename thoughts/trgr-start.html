    <p>Hello, this is Trgr.</p>
    <p>
      I've always felt the need to share. I think everyone does.
      <br />
      I don't know if it was the lack of close friends or the fascination with
      the internet, but I always did this through an online outlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was never really something that was "myself". I never wanted to
      be known by strangers. This is a project I start to change this. To have
      an outlet where I show myself to the world. To learn how to put my
      thoughts in words, and to start reflecting on my thoughts and opinions
      before I internalise them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very dark and pessimistic — even nihilistic at times — person, that
      tries not to drown in it. For a long time I hated myself and projected
      this onto the world. Now I don't hate myself anymore at all, but this
      negative view of the world remains. The disgust of how we, as a
      civilisation, treat others is still very active. In many forms. Towards
      many things and people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, I don't want this to just be a place filled with hatred and
      nihilism.
      <br />
      I also want to share about the things I like and about the hope I have
      for the future.
      <br />
      But I cannot promise anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is meant for people who want to kill time.
      <br />
      I cannot promise anything interesting. This is mainly written for
      myself, with an allowance of a third party. Not meant to be formal, but
      still thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't expect anything regular. I don't expect anyone reading this.
      <br />
      So no one has any obligations.
