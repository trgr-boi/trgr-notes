      <p>Hello, trgr here</p>
      <p>
        I finally released an album again. It isn’t one I made recently, but one
        that was just collecting dust on my sorage somewhere.
        <br />

        I still have to upload all my old music to Bandcamp. Not that I want to
        grow or anything, but just to have a public archive of what I made.
      </p>
      <p>
        The album is called ‘Homeworld: 2073’. It’s an old jungle live set I did
        back in October of 2023. For those that want to know, the concept for
        the album (not the music) is greatly inspired by artists like Deepspace,
        who try to tell stories through titles, and descriptions. This I want to
        do more : )
      </p>
      <p>
        The music itself is some classic jungle, now considered Intelligent DnB.
        Most of them consisting of classic jungle samples from packs like “Blu
        Mar Ten – Jungle Jungle” and “Zero-G Jungle Warfare 1, 2 & 3” sample
        packs. Sometimes so much that it was just drag and drop and a little bit
        of mixing.
        <br />

        But it was fun to make this!
