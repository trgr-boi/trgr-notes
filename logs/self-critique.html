      <i>2026-01-24</i> — Another day of forcing myself to focus, without any
      joy. Mainly because I know I won't have enough time and that will lead
      to just surface-level understanding of the topics...
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>2026-01-22</i> — I find it crazy how productive I can be. How much
      motivation I can have for my own dumb little projects. But how I cannot
      channel this motivation to things like school.
